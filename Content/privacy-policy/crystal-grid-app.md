# Privacy Policy for CrystalGrid app

#### Introduction

Welcome to CrystalGrid (“we”, “us”, “our”). We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how your data is handled when you use our app.


#### No Personal Data Collected

CrystalGrid does not collect, store, or process any personal data.
We do not request, gather, track, or transmit any information that could identify you as an individual.


#### Game Data Processed Only on Device

CrystalGrid processes all game data solely on your device.
This includes game state, settings, and similar game-related activity.


##### iCloud and Game Center

If you choose to use iCloud and/or Game Center, this may sync your game activity so it can appear across your devices. This data is stored on your devices and managed by Apple’s services, not by us.


#### No Third-Party Data Sharing

Because we do not collect any data ourselves, we do not share, sell, rent, or otherwise transfer any personal information to any third parties.


#### Children’s Privacy

CrystalGrid does not collect any personal data from users of any age, including children.
However, iCloud and Game Center usage is governed by Apple’s policies and parental controls.


#### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Effective Date” above, and you are encouraged to review the policy periodically. Continued use of CrystalGrid after changes means you accept the updated policy.

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our practices, please contact us via basargin.erik@gmail.com.
